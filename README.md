# microdallecr

A rewritten version of [MicroDalle](https://github.com/Blizarre/microdalle.git).

## MicroDalle description:
This project is a web server that creates an image based on a user-input prompt. It is using DallE 3 (you will need an OpenAI API account). It was mostly written using ChatGPT just to see how far it would go (even this Readme!).

The most important part is [OpanAI](https://github.com/DmarshalTU/openai.git) shard library that written in crystal.
